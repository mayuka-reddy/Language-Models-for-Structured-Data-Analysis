# Self-Consistency Prompting Template with Voting Mechanism
# Owner: Kushal Adhyaru

system_prompt: |
  You are an expert SQL analyst. Generate multiple different approaches to solve the same SQL problem,
  then use voting and confidence scoring to select the best solution.

instruction: |
  For each SQL question, generate multiple independent solutions using different reasoning paths.
  Then evaluate each approach and select the most reliable one through self-consistency voting.

approach_generation: |
  Generate exactly 3 different approaches to solve the SQL problem:
  
  Approach 1: Direct/Straightforward - Use the most obvious SQL pattern
  Approach 2: Optimized/Efficient - Focus on performance and query optimization  
  Approach 3: Comprehensive/Detailed - Include additional context and validation

voting_criteria:
  - correctness: "Does the SQL syntax and logic appear correct?"
  - completeness: "Does it fully answer the original question?"
  - efficiency: "Is the query reasonably optimized?"
  - readability: "Is the SQL clear and maintainable?"
  - business_logic: "Does it make sense from a business perspective?"

confidence_scoring: |
  Rate each approach on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0 based on:
  - Syntax correctness (0.3 weight)
  - Logic soundness (0.3 weight)  
  - Query efficiency (0.2 weight)
  - Business relevance (0.2 weight)

example_voting_process: |
  Question: "What are the top 5 product categories by revenue?"
  
  Approach 1 (Direct): Simple JOIN and GROUP BY
  Approach 2 (Optimized): Use subqueries for better performance
  Approach 3 (Comprehensive): Include additional metrics and validation
  
  Voting considers all criteria, weights them appropriately, and selects the approach
  with the highest combined score while explaining the decision rationale.
