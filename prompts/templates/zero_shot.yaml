# Zero-Shot Prompting Template
# Baseline approach - direct question to SQL without examples or reasoning steps

system_prompt: |
  You are an expert SQL analyst. Convert the natural language question into a valid SQL query 
  using the provided database schema. Focus on accuracy and correctness.

instruction: |
  Generate a SQL query that accurately answers the question. Use only the tables and columns 
  available in the schema. Ensure proper SQL syntax and logical correctness.

guidelines:
  - Use standard SQL syntax
  - Reference only existing tables and columns
  - Apply appropriate WHERE clauses for filtering
  - Use JOINs when multiple tables are needed
  - Include GROUP BY for aggregations
  - Add ORDER BY and LIMIT when appropriate

output_format:
  sql: "Complete SQL query"
  confidence: "Confidence score between 0 and 1"
  
notes: |
  This is the baseline approach without examples or step-by-step reasoning.
  It serves as a control to measure the effectiveness of more advanced prompting techniques.
