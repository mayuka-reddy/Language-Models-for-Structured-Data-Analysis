## 🎯 Project Overview

### The Problem
Industries store valuable knowledge in structured datasets (SQL, Parquet, CSV), but **non-technical users struggle to derive insights** because querying requires SQL expertise, schema knowledge, and data semantics understanding.

### Our Solution
We propose an **intelligent system** that converts natural-language questions into proper structured operations, returning accurate results with comprehensible explanations and schema grounding.

### Why It Matters
- 🔓 **Democratizes Data Access**: Brings non-technical users to data without compromising accuracy
- ⚡ **Saves Time**: Focuses analysts on interpretation rather than query construction
- 🎯 **Real-world Ready**: Adaptable to various datasets and domain-specific terminology
- 🧠 **AI-Powered**: Demonstrates how LLMs can become helpful data assistants

## 📊 Dataset

We use the **Olist Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset** (Kaggle) with ~100,000 customer orders from 2016-2018.

### 📋 Dataset Structure

| Dataset Type | Rows | Columns | Description |
|-------------|------|---------|-------------|
| **Item-Level** | 112,650 | 37 | Detailed item-level data with sellers, buyers, products, payments, reviews |
| **Order-Level** | 98,666 | 13 | Aggregated order-level data with financial summaries and shipping metrics |

### 🔍 Sample Queries Our System Handles
- *"What categories have the highest freight costs?"*
- *"Do late shipments decrease review scores?"*
- *"Which sellers have the best delivery performance?"*
- *"What's the average payment value by customer state?"*

## 🔧 Technical Approach

Our system combines **three cutting-edge techniques** to achieve state-of-the-art performance:

### 🧠 1. Advanced Prompting Strategies
We implement and compare four sophisticated prompting methods:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Natural Language Query] --> B[Prompting Strategy Selection]
    B --> C[Chain-of-Thought]
    B --> D[Few-Shot Learning]
    B --> E[Self-Consistency]
    B --> F[Least-to-Most]
    C --> G[SQL Generation]
    D --> G
    E --> G
    F --> G
```

| Strategy | Description | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Chain-of-Thought** | Step-by-step reasoning | Complex multi-table queries |
| **Few-Shot Learning** | Learning from examples | Domain-specific terminology |
| **Self-Consistency** | Multiple reasoning paths | Reducing hallucinations |
| **Least-to-Most** | Decomposing complex problems | Nested queries and aggregations |

### 🔍 2. Schema-Aware RAG Pipeline
Our retrieval system goes beyond traditional text-based RAG:

```mermaid

    A[Query] --> B[Schema Understanding]
    B --> C[Metadata Retrieval]
    C --> D[Column-Level Grounding]
    D --> E[Context Assembly]
    E --> F[SQL Synthesis]
```

**Key Innovations:**
- 🎯 **Schema Grounding**: Retrieval based on database metadata, not just text similarity
- 🔗 **Multi-table Reasoning**: Handles complex joins across customers, orders, products, reviews
- 📊 **Column-Level Precision**: Understands data types, constraints, and relationships

### 🎛️ 3. Fine-Tuning Strategies
We benchmark three fine-tuning approaches for optimal performance:

| Method | Description | Advantages |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **SFT** | Supervised Fine-Tuning | Full model adaptation |
| **LoRA** | Low-Rank Adaptation | Efficient parameter updates |
| **QLoRA** | Quantized LoRA | Memory-efficient training |

## Quick dev start (local testing)

If you want a minimal workflow to validate the Python code without loading large models or a database, follow these steps:

1. Create and activate a virtualenv:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run tests (a small unit test exists for SchemaManager):

```bash
pytest -q
```

4. Start the API (uses DummyModel by default):

```bash
uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload
```

Notes:
- The default NL2SQL generator uses `DummyModel` for quick local testing. Replace it with your model wrapper when ready.
- For schema reflection, set `DATABASE_URL` in the environment to point to a Postgres instance.
